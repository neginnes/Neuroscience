# Neuroscience
In this repo the homeworks and project of the course "advanced neuroscience", instructed by Dr. Ali Ghazizadeh, are added. 
Here is a brief discription for each forlder:

## [Neural Modeling](./Neural%20Modeling/)
Comparison of the computational models and the real neural data in terms of Coefficient
of Variation (CV) and Fano Factor.
## [Population Response](./Population%20Response/)
Study of the population response structure. 
and decoding.
## [Noise Correlation](./Noise%20Correlation/)
Study of the noise effect in population encoding and decoding.
## [Cortical Travelling Waves](./Cortical%20Travelling%20Waves/)
Analyzing the Local Field Potential activity ,recorded by multi-electrode array in premotor
area F5, to confirm the existence of traveling waves, and measuring their characteristics.
## [Classical Conditioning and Uncertainty](./Classical%20Conditioning%20and%20Uncertainty/)
Classical conditioning and learning with uncertainty.
## [Reinforcement Learning](./Reinforcement%20Learning/)
Simulation of a simple model of navigation problem using reinforcement learning in watermaze.
## [Evidence Accumulation and Decision Making](./Evidence%20Accumulation%20and%20Decision%20Making/)
Simulation of evidence accumulation model and studying the relationship
between accuracy and reaction time (RT) in decision making.
## [Visual Attention](./Visual%20Attention/)
Using saliency map based methods to predict where humans look.
## [Visual Model](./Visual%20Model/)
Study the sparse representation of natural image statistics as the receptive fields of simple cells
in primary visual cortex.

## [Grasping Effects (Motor Neurons)](./Grasping%20Effects%20(Motor%20Neurons)/) 
Analysis the effects of grasp dimension and grasp force on the motor cortex neuronsâ€™ responses
during reach to grasp in the monkey.

## [Neural Network (Feedback Alignment)](./Neural%20Network%20(Feedback%20Alignment)/)
Studing the feedback alignment method and it's underlying mechanism in backpropagation through random synaptic feedback weights (Final Project).



# Explanation
All folders contain an english report in .pdf format and a main matlab code named "HWxx.mat", "Main.mat", "Main.ipynb" to run. The rest .mat files are the written and used funtions.
